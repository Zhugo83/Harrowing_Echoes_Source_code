The large amount of illiterate children spamming the threads is annoying.

Friday Night Funkin' is a game meant for teens. 

The whole premise of the game is that you're "trying to fuck your gf" "funky on a friday night" the literal 'blue balls' joke on the death screen. SENPAIS DIALOUGE??? The sexualization of the mom. (Which is also called a MILF) Dads pubic hair, the moms song names. The (pretty funny) STRONG language on week 7. And (this is maybe a joke) but there's supposedly going to be a pegging scene. THIS. IS NOT. A GAME MEANT FOR CHILDREN??? And yet they're beginning to swarm the fandom. 

I don't genuinely care if kids enjoy this game, but I already see kids whining about the nsfw stuff. And I bet you there's going to be parents whining and bitching when there's even more sex jokes in the future weeks. Because there's certainly going to be.

I don't want this fandom to be the next Undertale. Undertale was a genuinely amazing game, but little kids took over the fandom and ruined it. It's starting to happen to FNF. I've already seen those crappy "youtube kids" animations with FNF characters. It's sickening. 

This site, has literal porn games on it aswell. Shoo. Scram. You can still play the game or whatever but stop whining about the nsfw stuff and GET OFF THE THREADS.

I'm not even mentioning how annoying the "funniest guys" spam accounts are. They're almost all trolls. Maybe not kids. But they're just annoying.
